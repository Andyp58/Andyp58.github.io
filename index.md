## My favorite labs

* Lab 4 Part-2
I like this part of lab 4 because we used if/else statements to make a small game where the user had to type a certain number to get it correct and it showed what creative things you could do with if/else statements.

* Lab 5
I thought lab 5 was my favorite lab because it showed us how to ask the user for a prompt and use that answer given to us. I also liked it because it had us make a calculator, and how to convert decimal feet to feet and inches.

* Lab 10
I liked lab 10 because it showed me how to use bool and and for and if statements to check multiple things at once. It also helped me better understand how and when vectors can be used effectively.
